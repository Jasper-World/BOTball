# BOTball
In the winter vocation,I attend the botball race I’am the master group,there seven project you need to success four on the morning and three on the afternoon and there’s a mystery project,in each pm and am you need to build a robot first and let the robot to clamp the can.
It start at half past nine in the morning,there only two hour and thirteen minute so I highly recommend you to division of labor if you are three person a teem you could let the most capable person to do program of average difficulty,at the same time the other two will done the most difficult project I did that it was very useful if you do that you could finish the project.
In the afternoon you could make the two project together and if you have time you could start doing the mystery project,now someone will ask why don’t do the mystery project at the first place because that one is the most difficult one if you waste the time on it you wouldn’t have time to do the other. 
Know I want to talk about my build idea,first I build a simple car and if you want to clamp the can a mechanical grip might help,and if the project let you to lift up the can then you should have a elevator.

And if you need to line patrol then you can and two color sensor.
For the program a use the gyroscope program that I made myself you can see my last subject and the line patrol program was in it too.
The lasting thing I want to say is about to choose the teammate,if you are very capable then that not really matter but if you are of average ability then you need to think hard,I strongly recommend you to have three person I teem because it’s better to division of labor especially you are the master group.
For all I want to say that “Not until the last minute,Don’t give up”
